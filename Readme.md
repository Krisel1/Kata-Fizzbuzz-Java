# FizzBuzz in Java

This is a Java project that implements the FizzBuzz kata using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Description
The FizzBuzz kata is a classic exercise used to learn programming logic and solve simple problems efficiently. Here are the rules of the kata:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
- This project implements these rules in Java using classes and objects.

## Repository Contents

Main.java: Class handling the logic for printing numbers according to the FizzBuzz rules.
FizzBuzzTest.java: Unit tests using JUnit to verify the correct functionality of the code.
